### 1. How do I reset my password?
You can reset your password from the login screen by selecting **“Forgot Password.”** A reset link is emailed instantly. The link stays valid for **30 minutes**. If you don’t receive the email, check your spam folder or verify that your registered address is correct in your profile settings.

### 2. Why is the app running slowly?
Common reasons include low device memory, an outdated app version, or poor network quality. **Restarting the app** often clears the temporary cache. If performance doesn’t improve, update to the latest version or check for high background CPU usage.

### 3. How do I enable two-factor authentication (2FA)?
Go to **Settings → Security → Two-Factor Authentication**. Choose between SMS or an authenticator app. After setup, you receive a **backup code** that should be stored safely. 2FA becomes active immediately after verification.

### 4. Does the app work offline?
Core features like viewing previously synced data work offline. Any actions requiring server communication, such as submitting forms or fetching new content, require an **active internet connection**. Offline actions sync automatically when connectivity returns.

### 5. How do I report a bug?
Navigate to **Help → Report Issue**. Attach screenshots or logs if possible. Each report generates a **tracking ID**. You can check the issue status in the Help section under “My Reports.”

### 6. How do I clear cached data?
Open **Settings → Storage → Clear Cache**. This removes temporary files **without affecting personal data**. Clearing the cache helps fix load delays, image rendering issues, and stuck states.

### 7. What devices are supported?
The app supports **Android 10 or later** and **iOS 14 or later**. Web access is available on modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Older OS versions may experience limited functionality.

### 8. Why am I not receiving notifications?
Check that notifications are enabled in **both system settings and inside the app’s Notification Center**. Ensure battery optimization is not restricting background processes. If notifications are delayed, verify that your device has stable connectivity.

### 9. How do I export my data?
Go to **Profile → Data Control → Export Data**. Choose PDF, CSV, or JSON format. The export is prepared on the server and emailed within **5–10 minutes**. Large exports may take longer.

### 10. How do I delete my account?
Account deletion is found under **Profile → Data Control → Delete Account**. The process requires password confirmation. All personal data is **permanently removed within 7 days** unless local law requires retention.
