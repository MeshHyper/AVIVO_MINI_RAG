### 1. How do I update the application?
Updates appear automatically in your device’s app store. If the store doesn’t show an update, pull to refresh the updates page. On desktop, download the latest installer from the official website. Updating never removes your data.

### 2. Why can’t I log in even with the correct password?
If you’re sure the password is correct, the issue may be:
* Account temporarily locked after too many attempts
* Server maintenance in progress
* Unverified email address

Unlocks happen automatically after **15 minutes**. Maintenance notices appear on the status page.

### 3. How do I sync my data across devices?
Sign in using the same account on all devices. Data sync happens in the background through encrypted cloud storage. If changes don’t appear, open **Settings → Sync → “Force Sync.”**

### 4. What should I do if the screen freezes?
Force-close the app, then reopen it. If the freeze persists, check for low device storage or conflicting accessibility overlays. **Reinstalling the app is safe**; all cloud data is restored on login.

### 5. Does the app track my location?
Location is used only if you enable features that require it, such as geotagging or nearby device pairing. The app **never collects location data silently**. You can disable location at any time from your OS permissions.

### 6. Why is the battery draining fast?
High-refresh pages, constant background sync, or unstable network conditions can cause battery spikes. Enable **battery-saver mode** inside the app, or reduce live auto-refresh intervals from **Settings → Performance**.

### 7. How do I change the app theme?
Themes live in **Settings → Appearance**. You can switch between Light, Dark, High Contrast, or System Adaptive. Changes apply instantly without needing a restart.

### 8. How do I restore deleted items?
Recently deleted items remain in the **“Recycle” section for 30 days**. You can restore or permanently delete them from there. Items older than 30 days are unrecoverable.

### 9. Why is my file upload failing?
Possible reasons include:
* File exceeds the maximum size limit
* Unsupported file format
* Interrupted connection during upload

Compressing media or switching to a stable network often resolves the issue.

### 10. How do I contact support?
Open **Help → Contact Support**. You can choose chat, email, or a callback request. Average response time is under **4 hours**. Priority support is available for premium users.
