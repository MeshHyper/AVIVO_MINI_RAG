### 1. How do I disable automatic updates?
Go to **Settings → Updates → Toggle off “Auto-Update.”** You will still receive update alerts, but installation becomes manual.

### 2. Why does the app sign me out?
For security, sessions expire after **24 hours of inactivity** or when your login token changes. Using VPNs or switching networks rapidly may also trigger re-authentication.

### 3. How do I reset app settings?
Navigate to **Settings → Advanced → Reset App Settings**. This restores defaults **without deleting personal data** or cloud content.

### 4. Is my data encrypted?
Yes. Data is encrypted at rest using **AES-256** and in transit using **TLS 1.3**. Keys are never stored on user devices.

### 5. How do I reduce mobile data usage?
Enable **Data Saver** from **Settings → Network**. This limits auto-sync, shrinks image previews, and disables background refresh.

### 6. Why do videos buffer?
Low bandwidth, server congestion, or outdated codecs may cause buffering. Refreshing the stream or switching networks usually fixes it.

### 7. Can I use the app on multiple accounts?
Yes. You can add multiple accounts under **Profile → Switch Account**. Each account retains its own settings.

### 8. Why can't I download files?
Storage permissions might be disabled. Enable them in your device settings. Also confirm you have **enough disk space**.

### 9. How do I manage notifications per feature?
Inside **Settings → Notifications**, you can toggle modules individually: messages, alerts, reminders, updates, and system events.

### 10. How do I change my username?
Usernames can be changed once every **30 days** from **Profile → Edit Details**, unless they are globally unique handles.
