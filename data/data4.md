### 1. What should I do if my app won’t install?
Clear your device’s app-store cache, ensure you have **enough storage**, and confirm that your OS version meets the minimum requirement.

### 2. Why is dark mode unavailable?
Dark mode requires **OS theme support**. If your OS theme is locked or outdated, the app hides the option.

### 5. Can I customize shortcuts?
Yes. Shortcut configuration is available under **Settings → Accessibility → Quick Actions**.

Large image resolutions or throttled CDN nodes may delay loading. Clearing cache or selecting **“Optimize Images”** helps.

### 7. How do I disable sound effects?
Toggle **“Sound Feedback”** under **Settings → Accessibility → Audio**.

Free-tier accounts show personalized ads. Ads reduce if you **revoke personalization** or upgrade to premium.

You can generate a temporary share link under **Profile → Share Data**. Links auto-expire after **24 hours**.

### 10. How do I block another user?
